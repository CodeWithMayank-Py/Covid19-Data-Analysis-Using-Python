# COVID-19 and Happiness Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file for analyzing the COVID-19 dataset in conjunction with the happiness dataset. The analysis aims to explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and happiness levels across different regions.

## Dataset
- **COVID-19 Dataset**: The COVID-19 dataset contains information about the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across various countries and regions.
- **Happiness Dataset**: The happiness dataset includes metrics related to happiness levels, such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook file (`COVID19_Happiness_Analysis.ipynb`) provides detailed analysis and visualization of the datasets. Some of the key aspects covered in the analysis include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 and happiness datasets.
- Correlation analysis between COVID-19 statistics and happiness metrics.
- Visualization of trends and patterns using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

## How to Use
To replicate or explore the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `COVID19_Happiness_Analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.
